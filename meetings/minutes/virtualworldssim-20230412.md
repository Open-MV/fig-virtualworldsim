# AI meeting summary:

The speakers discuss the results of a previous meeting and review screenshots of Patero running in a browser. They also discuss Daikon, a modular format for describing objects and packaging metaverse data, including its structure and potential limitations with CDNs. There are concerns about using 64-bit offsets for size and offset fields due to possible issues with range requests on CDNs. The speakers consider whether to limit Daikon to the current CDN limit or future-proof it for larger files.

The transcript discusses the benefits and limitations of using 2 gigabyte files for content delivery networks (CDNs) and how it affects different use cases such as gaming. The speakers also discuss the need for a lookup model or resolver point to identify assets within virtual worlds and simulations, possibly through a universal identifier system similar to DNS or security certificates. They also mention collaborative drawing projects and the potential for using this format structure as an inbound format in PlayCanvas.

The transcript is a conversation between several individuals discussing various topics related to software development and virtual worlds. They discuss the need for theory and simple web servers, the benefits of both interactive and asynchronous discussions, their backgrounds in programming and involvement in medical research organizations, limitations of current virtual world models, the idea of a meta computer with distributed computing power, and the potential integration of spatial computing into operating systems.

The conversation revolves around the idea of a distributed compute operating system, with mentions of Patero and Daikon. The participants discuss the evolution of operating systems, from text-based to GUI-based interfaces, and the role of drivers in kernel space. They also touch upon VR technology and its potential for computing systems. The conversation ends with plans to put Daki Diacompatero into practice and a general appreciation for the discussion.
